# Arabic-Empathetic-Chatbot


This repository contains a dataset of ~38K samples of open-domain utterances and empathetic responses in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).

The dataset has been published in the paper [Empathy-driven Arabic Conversational Chatbot](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.wanlp-1.6/).

The repository also contains the code for the state-of-the-art BERT2BERT model for Arabic response generation, published in the paper [Empathetic BERT2BERT Conversational Model: Learning Arabic Language Generation with Little Data](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2021.wanlp-1.17/)
